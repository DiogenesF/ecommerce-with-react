# ecommerce-with-react
### The directories 'água' (water) and 'fogo' (fire) contains the app in React. Both are the same app, just changing the colors, also, the 'água' project has more features.

The app is a simple ecommerce built using react.
The API https://pokeapi.co/ was used to fetch data

It was also used the localStorage to store the supposed last acquisition by the user in the platform.

The app makes use of techniques to improve the performance, as React.memo to avoid unecessary rerenders, and Lazy loading to load only the items who are currently visible to the users in the screen

### `The layout was built using grid and flexbox to make it fully responsive`

### Running the app
Just cd into one of the two folders and run:

`$ npm install`
and
`$ npm start`
